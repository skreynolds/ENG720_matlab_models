# ENG720 Honours Thesis - MATLAB Simulation

This repository contains a selection of power systems models with load frequency controllers. Works contained herein are mostly experimentation using MATLAB and Simulink to replicate research papers, or to understand different model architectures, test model parameters, or try different classical control schemes for the AGC/LFC problem.

## MATLAB/Simulink Models

Briefly this repository is broken into two key sections:

1. Single area power systems
2. Two area power systems

Each section will contain an assortment of models.

Blog posts explaining the development of single area and two area power system models can be found [here]() and [here]().

The intention is to use MATLAB and Simulink for rapid model iteration, and ultimately implement final models into a Python environment. A link to the Python models used in my thesis work can be found [here](https://blank.org/).

## Thesis report

The thesis work aims to present a case for automatic generation control of a two area power system using a deep reinforcement learning agent. The developed model is compared against classical control techniques. A link to the thesis report repository can be found [here](https://github.com/skreynolds/ENG720_honours_thesis).
